### Dataset Overview:
We used the dataset on [Package Pricing at Mission Hospital](https://github.com/SrivaniJayanthi/Machine-Learning-with-Hospital-treatment-package-data-set/blob/main/Package%20Pricing%20at%20Mission%20Hospital%20-%20Data%20Supplement.xlsx) to develop and evaluate various machine learning regression models. These models include:
<br>
Linear Regression <br>
Decision Tree Regression <br>
Random Forest Regression <br>
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regression <br>
Bayesian Regression <br>
Among these, the Random Forest model achieved the highest accuracy with an R-squared value of 0.77.
<br>
For a detailed, step-by-step explanation of the code, including tuning and testing of the models, refer to the [FINAL_R2](https://github.com/SrivaniJayanthi/Machine-Learning-with-Hospital-treatment-package-data-set/blob/main/FINAL_R2.ipynb) notebook.
